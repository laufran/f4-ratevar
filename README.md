# pipeline to study lineage rate variation's effect on f4 stats

Code to reproduce the simulation study in: Frankel & An√© (2025) "Low accuracy of complex admixture graph inference from f-statistics".

Preprint available here: <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.07.642126v1>

## goal and model

Goal: simulate sequence data (SNPs) under a network model reflecting
archaic human population genetics with ILS and lineage rate variation,
to answer these questions:

1. How does f4 perform when there is lineage rate variation?
2. How much lineage rate variation causes consequential type-1 error,
or a reduction in power?
3. How are the admixture graphs inferred from f4 results affected?
